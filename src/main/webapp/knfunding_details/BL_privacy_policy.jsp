                    <li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights
        (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud

                <li>we may display some information that is publicly available on KN funding Platform, on third party websites that are closely
                connected to the KN funding Platform project and wish to
                embed KN funding Platform activity. So, by way of example,
                user generated content such as titles of users’ posts on KN funding Platform groups would be displayed on such third party
                sites with a link back to KN funding Platform. To the
                extent that usernames or personal information is included in that user
                generated content on KN funding Platform, it may be
                displayed on such third party sites. So for example if a listing
                included a username or a member’s photo, that information may also be
                displayed on the third party website. Just to be clear, this information
                will be embedded on any such third party website as a link. We will not
                hand over that information to the third party website;</li>
                
                <li>we may display some information that is publicly available on KN funding Platform in the regular newsletters that are emailed
                to all registered users on the KN funding Platform mailing
                list.</li>
    
    
        <li>we may use your personal information to investigate a complaint made
        by a user of KN funding Platform, or a breach of KN funding Platform’s Terms of Use and to prevent and detect
        criminal activity, fraud and misuse of or damage to KN funding Platform or the service made available through it and to
        prosecute those responsible.</li>

            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <div>
             <p>KN funding is chennai's first social change platform. What is a social change platform you may ask? In short,
                 it is an umbrella of products, aimed at creating a better tomorrow for individuals and the society.
             </p>
             <p>When I started KN funding, our sole objective was to help change peopleâ€™s lives for the better. 
                During the course of our journey, I have been fortunate enough to help wipe off a few tears and bring a smile to peopleâ€™s faces.
            </p>
             </div>   

            <div>

            <h2>Our Offerings</h2>

            <p>We believe in empowering people.

                 Once you register and submit your cause, our team approves it within 24 hours and you are good to go.</p>

            <p><b>KN funding Campaign:</b> Money is an essential in todayâ€™s society and one should never suffer due to a lack of it.

                feeding and education people or raising funds for any social cause â€“ 
                KN funding and its generous community will be your pillar of support.</p>

                <p>In our brief journey, we have helped save lives, raised funds for families reeling in tragedy and

                <!-- <p> The easiest answer would be â€“ we are the only platform in chennai which allows you to create campaigns.
                     A better answer would be â€“ I am building a social change ecosystem. 
                    </p> -->
                <p>Our aim is to provide every possible tool in peopleâ€™s hands which will enable them to bring about 
                    a change in their personal lives and the society. To this end, we are coming up with our social media platform â€“ 
                    completely different from prevalent models, which will bring together campaigners, 
                    benefactors and the general public on a single platform. Thus, helping create a community dedicated to bring about a
                    positive change.

                    We sustain ourselves through contributions from our benefactors and always try to waive off any 
                    financial commitment from the campaigners.

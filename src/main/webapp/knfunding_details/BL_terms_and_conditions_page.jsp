                    <h4>KN funding is a internet Venue and a Service Provider</h4>
                <P>KN funding is an online community crowdfunding platform and acts as a venue to allow members who comply 
                    with KN funding Policies to raise funds to fulfil their dreams of starting, running and growing their own business,
                     to get projects started, or to raise funds for charitable projects. KN funding allows individuals, 
                     groups and organisations (“Campaign Creators”) to list campaigns and raise funds through experiences, 
                     donations,  and/or services (“Rewards”) to new and existing KN funding members (“Campaign Supporters”). 
                     KN funding is not directly involved in the transaction between Campaign Creators and Campaign Supporters.
                      KN funding has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of Campaigns or 
                      Rewards listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Campaign Creator to complete the 
                      Campaign or Rewards, or the ability of a Campaign Supporter to actually pay promised monies. KN funding 
                      cannot ensure that a Campaign Supporter or a Campaign Creator will actually complete a transaction. 
                      Consequently, KN funding does not transfer legal ownership of Rewards from the Campaign Supporter to the 
                      Campaign Creator. KN funding cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a member. KN funding 
                      recommend that you check the member’s bio and history on the Site for background information and do your own
                       research before providing funds. KN funding is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content
                       , for example, data, text, information, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links 
                       posted by you, other members, or outside parties on KN funding. You agree that use of KN funding services is at your own risk.

                <h4>Campaigns</h4> 
                    <p>KN funding is not involved in the development of Campaigns. It is the responsibility of the Campaign Creator 
                         to fulfill the promises of their Campaign or Petition. KN funding reviews Campaigns 
                          to ensure they do not violate KN funding Terms and Conditions, however does not
                           investigate a Campaign Creator or Petitioner’s ability to complete their Campaigns.
                            KN funding cannot be held liable for the actions of a Campaign Creator. 
                            Campaign Creators are wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both 
                            implied and stated in any Campaign listing they create. KN funding does not
                             oversee the performance or punctuality of Campaigns. KN funding reserves the 
                             right to remove a Campaign listing from public listings for any reason. All 
                             dealings on KN funding are solely between you and such individuals and/or organisations
                             . KN funding is not responsible for any damage or loss incurred as a result of any dealings
                              on the KN funding platform and is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between
                               Campaign Supporters and Campaign Creators, or between site members and any third party. 
                               In the event of a dispute, you agree that you release KN funding employees, partners and
                                successors in rights from claims, damages and demands of every kind, known or unknown, 
                                suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related 
                                to such disputes and KN funding service. KN funding cannot guarantee the performance or
                                 reliability of the Payment Gateway partners online payment services. KN funding cannot
                                  guarantee the full receipt of promised funds to a Campaign due to occasional failures
                                   when capturing funds from debit and credit cards.

                       <p> You can also drop us an email on causes@KN funding.com with all the necessary details. 
                        We would require the Campaign name, Transaction details, Receipt number, mode of payment, 
                        contact number and email address which was used while making the contribution. Please note a
                        refund will only be processed if it is requested within 48 hrs of the transaction. Once the 
                        fundraiser/campaign has been paid out, no refund request will be accepted.

                        <p>
                        On occasion it is possible that a pledge made by a Campaign Supporter will be 
                        returned to the Campaign Supporter by Payment Gateway partners (for example if there 
                        has been fraud on their debit/credit card, transaction timing out etc). In these circumstances
                        it may be that the amount shown on the KN funding website will show a higher amount raised on a 
                        campaign until KN funding are informed by Payment Gateway partners of the need to make an adjustment. 
                        Once we have been informed we will endeavor to make the adjustment within 2 working days.

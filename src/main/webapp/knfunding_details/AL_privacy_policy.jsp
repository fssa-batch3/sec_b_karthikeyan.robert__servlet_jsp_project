                        <li>provide our service to you. This includes for example registering
                                your account; providing you with other products and services that you
                                have requested; providing you with promotional items at your request and
                                communicating with you in relation to those products and services;
                                communicating and interacting with you; and notifying you of changes to
                                any services.

                        <li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights

                    <li>we may display some information that is publicly available on KN funding Platform, on third party websites that are closely
                    connected to the KN funding Platform project and wish to
                    embed KN funding Platform activity. So, by way of example,
                    user generated content such as titles of users’ posts on KN funding Platform groups would be displayed on such third party
                    sites with a link back to KN funding Platform. To the
                    extent that usernames or personal information is included in that user
                    generated content on KN funding Platform, it may be
                    displayed on such third party sites. So for example if a listing
                    included a username or a member’s photo, that information may also be
                    displayed on the third party website. Just to be clear, this information
                    will be embedded on any such third party website as a link. We will not
